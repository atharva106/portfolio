                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p class="about">I have believed in the notion that one should do things that they are interested in, otherwise, you will always be a misfit resulting in only failures. Information Technology was always a subject that enticed me. What started as a machine to carry out complex mathematical calculations and occupied a big room, needed separate cards to be punched to operate it, has over time evolved into a tiny little thing fitting into a handheld device and able to carry out a phenomenal number of activities. Technology holds the power to revolutionize the whole world and being a part of this revolution is my dream.
                    <br>My intent of doing undergraduate studies in Information Technology is to keep me associated with the software development field and to acquire comprehensive knowledge and associated application skills related to all the aspects of computing. I am well aware that the path on my way ahead to become a successful professional in the IT field would test me to the fullest and I am committed to being a worthy student and a hardworking team player.<br>With a passion for programming, web designing, IoT and technology, I  believe that I am ready to battle in the competitive arena. I have worked with both the software and the hardware of a machine and thus I believe that I have the skill set necessary to dive deeper and explore my way in this subject. As an upbeat, punctual, dynamic and self-motivated team player with excellent communication and practicality, I envision an exciting future in this industry.<br> Browse my website to see all that I have to offer.</p>
